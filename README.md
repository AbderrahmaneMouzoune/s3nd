# s3nd

Move a local-first app's data from one device to another, through your own bucket.

```ts
import { createBucket } from 's3nd'

const store = createBucket({ bucket: 'my-bucket', prefix: 'snapshots' })

// On the old device: hand the user a code.
const code = store.codes.create() // "K7QP2M4X"
await store.putSnapshot(code, state, { app: 'notes', version: 3, expiresIn: 3600 })

// On the new device: they type it in.
const snapshot = await store.getSnapshot(store.codes.normalize(typed), { maxVersion: 3 })
snapshot?.data // → the state, ready to write back into IndexedDB
```

Your app keeps everything in IndexedDB: fast, offline, private. Then the user opens it on their
phone and it is empty, because IndexedDB does not leave the browser it was written in. s3nd
is the small server-side piece that closes that gap.

Credentials stay on your server — the browser only ever talks to your own API, so there is no CORS
policy to write on the bucket and nothing to sign client-side. Works with AWS S3, Cloudflare R2,
MinIO, Scaleway and any S3-compatible storage.

```sh
npm install s3nd
```

## This repository

A bun workspace monorepo, driven by Turborepo.

It was called `bucketcode` until the packages were renamed to `s3nd`, and moved here with its
full history; [the old repository](https://github.com/AbderrahmaneMouzoune/bucketcode) is
archived. On npm that leaves `bucketcode@0.1.0` as the last release under the old name — it is
deprecated in favour of `s3nd`, and a snapshot written by it still reads back, which
[`packages/s3nd/src/snapshot.ts`](./packages/s3nd/src/snapshot.ts) covers.

| Path                                                   | What it is                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`packages/protocol`](./packages/protocol)             | `@s3nd/protocol` — the wire contract, a client, sync codes. No storage client, so it bundles for a browser.              |
| [`packages/s3nd`](./packages/s3nd)                     | `s3nd` — the S3 primitive: snapshots, files, the handler.                                                                |
| [`packages/react`](./packages/react)                   | `@s3nd/react` — hooks. Depends on the protocol, never on S3.                                                             |
| [`packages/cli`](./packages/cli)                       | `@s3nd/cli` — the `s3nd` binary, built on the primitive.                                                                 |
| [`apps/docs`](./apps/docs)                             | The documentation site — guides, use cases, API reference. Served from doc.s3nd.sh.                                      |
| [`apps/website`](./apps/website)                       | The marketing site at s3nd.sh — what it is, the three ways in, use cases, providers, comparisons.                        |
| [`examples/indexeddb-sync`](./examples/indexeddb-sync) | A notes app in IndexedDB, moved between devices with a code.                                                             |
| [`examples/node-script`](./examples/node-script)       | Snapshot round-trip, expiry and conflicts in one file.                                                                   |
| [`templates/drop`](./templates/drop)                   | A small WeTransfer on your own bucket, live at drop.s3nd.sh: the one-click Vercel template, on `s3nd` and `@s3nd/react`. |

The split follows one constraint: a browser must never end up with a storage client in its
dependency tree. `@s3nd/protocol` is what both halves share, which is why it exists at all
rather than living inside `s3nd`.

```
@s3nd/protocol   nanoid                      the contract, shared by everything
s3nd             + aws-sdk, protocol         the S3 primitive
@s3nd/react      + protocol, react (peer)    hooks — no path to S3
@s3nd/cli        + s3nd                the binary
```

## Working on it

A [bun](https://bun.com) workspace, with [Turborepo](https://turborepo.dev) running the tasks.

```sh
bun install
bun run build        # turbo build across the workspace
bun run test         # the package's test suite
bun run type-check
bun run lint
bun run format
```

Run the docs site locally with `bun run --filter @s3nd/docs dev` — it listens on
[localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100). The website is `bun run --filter @s3nd/website dev`, on
[localhost:3300](http://localhost:3300), and the drop template is `bun run --filter s3nd-drop dev`, on
[localhost:3400](http://localhost:3400).

The template depends on `s3nd@^0.1.0` and `@s3nd/react@^0.1.0` rather than on `workspace:*`, on
purpose: bun links the workspace packages while the version matches, so it builds here against the
local source, and the same `package.json` installs from npm once it is cloned on its own, which is
what the Vercel deploy button does.

bun installs and orchestrates; the toolchain itself still runs on Node. That is deliberate rather
than half-finished: `s3nd` is published for Node, so the test suite runs on Node — CI runs it
on 20, 22 and 24 — and `.bin/vitest` carries a `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang, so it picks up
whichever version is on `PATH`. Switching the runner to `bun test` would trade that coverage for a
second or two of wall clock.

The test suite is offline: it runs against an in-memory stand-in for S3 that honours the
conditional headers, so snapshots genuinely round-trip without credentials or network. For an
integration check against the real protocol, point an example at a local MinIO:

```sh
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 \
  -e MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin -e MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin \
  quay.io/minio/minio server /data --console-address ":9001"
```

## Releasing

Releases are driven by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) and by the
commit messages that land on `main`, which follow
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Pull requests are squash-merged, so
the pull request title is the message that counts — CI checks its shape on every pull request.

| A commit on `main`                         | Takes 0.1.0 to                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `fix: …`                                   | 0.1.1                                  |
| `feat: …`                                  | 0.2.0                                  |
| `feat!: …`, or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | 0.2.0 — the major bump waits for 1.0.0 |
| `chore: …`, `ci: …`, `docs: …`, `test: …`  | nowhere, no release                    |

Only commits touching `packages/s3nd` release it; the docs site, the examples and the
workflows do not.

While there is something to release, the [release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml) keeps
a `chore: release x.y.z` pull request open, carrying the version bump and the entry it would add to
[the changelog](./packages/s3nd/CHANGELOG.md). Merging it is the release: the commit is
tagged `vx.y.z`, the GitHub release is created from that changelog entry, and the package is
published to npm with provenance.

[`release-please-config.json`](./release-please-config.json) holds the settings;
[`.release-please-manifest.json`](./.release-please-manifest.json) holds the last released version
and is rewritten by release-please, so leave it alone.

Two repository secrets:

- `NPM_TOKEN`, with publish rights. If you would rather use npm trusted publishing, configure this
  repository as a trusted publisher on npm and drop the `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` line from the workflow —
  the `id-token: write` permission it already grants is what OIDC needs.
- `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN`, optional: a personal access token with `contents` and `pull-requests`
  write access. GitHub skips workflows on pull requests opened with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so
  without it the release pull request shows no checks.

Running the workflow by hand with **Publish** ticked publishes the version currently on `main` —
the way out when a release was tagged but the publish step failed.
