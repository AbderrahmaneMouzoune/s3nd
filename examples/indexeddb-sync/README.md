# IndexedDB sync example

A notes app that keeps everything in IndexedDB, and moves it to another device with a code.

Open it in two different browsers to see the point: the second one is empty, because IndexedDB is
scoped to one origin in one browser profile on one device. Prepare a transfer in the first, type
the code into the second, and the database follows.

| Route                    | Does                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /api/sync`         | Snapshots the posted database under a fresh code and returns it.  |
| `GET /api/sync/:code`    | The database behind a code, or 404 when it is unknown or expired. |
| `DELETE /api/sync/:code` | Burns the code once the transfer worked.                          |

## Run it

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local
bun install
bun run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3200 in two different browsers: two profiles, or one normal window and
one private window. Two tabs of the same browser share the same IndexedDB, so they will not show
you anything.

`.env.example` points at a local MinIO, which is the quickest way to exercise the real code path:

```sh
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 9001:9001 \
  -e MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin -e MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin \
  quay.io/minio/minio server /data --console-address ":9001"
```

Create the bucket once from the console at http://localhost:9001.

## What is where

| File             |                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lib/db.ts`      | The IndexedDB store, and the `exportDatabase` / `importDatabase` pair a transfer needs. |
| `lib/sync.ts`    | The browser half: post the dump, look a code up, apply it.                              |
| `lib/store.ts`   | The bucket, built lazily, with `maxSize` under the platform limit.                      |
| `app/api/sync/…` | The two routes. Around forty lines, most of it error mapping.                           |

`lib/db.ts` is deliberately application code. Only your app knows its own object stores, which is
why s3nd does not try to dump IndexedDB generically: a generic dumper would be wrong for
most schemas and subtly wrong for the rest.

## Worth noticing

- **The code is shown grouped in fours**, because someone has to read it off one screen and type
  it into another. `store.codes.normalize()` on the server accepts it with or without the spaces,
  in any case, and folds `O` to zero and `I`/`L` to one. Change `syncCode` in `lib/store.ts` (to
  four digits, say) and both halves follow.
- **Nothing is imported before the user confirms.** Looking a code up fetches the snapshot and
  shows what it holds (how many notes, from which device, saved when) and only then offers to
  replace what is there. The most common mistake is restoring onto the device that already had the
  data.
- **`ifAbsent: true` on write.** A generated code landing on one already in use is unlikely, but
  overwriting a stranger's transfer is bad enough to be worth one header.
- **`expiresIn` is an hour.** A transfer code is a bearer token; a short life is most of its
  security. The `DELETE` after a successful import is the tidy path, the expiry is the backstop.
- **`importDatabase` runs in a single transaction.** Clear and repopulate every store at once, so
  a failure halfway leaves the previous contents intact instead of half of each.
- **The schema version travels with the snapshot.** A snapshot from a newer build of the app makes
  the read fail with a clear message rather than landing in a version that would misread it.

## What it does not do

There is no merge. Restoring replaces the receiving device's database: the right model for
carrying data to a new phone, the wrong one for two devices editing at once. For that, see
[continuous backup](../../apps/docs/app/docs/use-cases/continuous-backup/page.mdx) and
[two devices, one snapshot](../../apps/docs/app/docs/two-devices/page.mdx).

Attachments are out of scope here too: this store holds text. Blobs belong beside the snapshot
rather than inside it; see
[attachments beside the data](../../apps/docs/app/docs/use-cases/attachments/page.mdx).
