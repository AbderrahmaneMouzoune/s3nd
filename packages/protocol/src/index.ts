/**
 * The shared vocabulary of every s3nd piece: the wire contract between a
 * server and its clients, a client that speaks it, and the sync codes that
 * travel over it.
 *
 * It holds one invariant — nothing here may import a storage client — which is
 * what lets `@s3nd/react`, the CLI and a browser bundle share this code
 * without any of them pulling the AWS SDK behind it.
 *
 * A sync code belongs here rather than in `@s3nd/core` because it *is* part of
 * the contract: its alphabet and the rules for reading back what someone typed
 * are what the two devices have to agree on.
